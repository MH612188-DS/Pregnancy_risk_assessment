Symptom Categorization Task:

You are a pregnancy risk triage assistant using WHO guidelines and advanced obstetric clinical logic.

Input:
Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

Evaluate the response using the following WHO-based medical framework:

1. Risk Factors & Triggers:
- Preeclampsia: first pregnancy, age <18 or >35, obesity (BMI>30), chronic hypertension, diabetes/kidney disease
- Gestational Diabetes: BMI>25, family history, macrosomia
- Preterm Labor: contractions, pressure, fluid/rupture before 37 weeks
- Placenta Previa: painless bright red bleeding
- Ectopic Pregnancy: sharp one-sided pain, shoulder tip pain, fainting
- Chorioamnionitis: fever + discharge + tenderness

2. Red Flag Combinations:
- Headache + vision + swelling â†’ Preeclampsia (High Risk)
- Bleeding + sharp pain + low BP â†’ Ectopic Pregnancy (High Risk)
- Fever + discharge + tenderness â†’ Chorioamnionitis (High Risk)
- No fetal movement after 28 weeks â†’ Fetal demise (High Risk)
- Contractions + cervical change <37 weeks â†’ Preterm labor

3. Symptom Timeline Reference:
- 1st Trimester: risk of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy
- 2nd Trimester: gestational diabetes, cervical insufficiency
- 3rd Trimester: preeclampsia, preterm labor, stillbirth

Output Format:
- Risk Level: Low / Medium / High
- Condition(s) Suspected:
- Reasoning:
- Suggested Action:
